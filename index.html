        <p>Hi, my name is Randy. I have many interests but am currently working on my web development/coding skills to become a software engineer. <br>
        I started off my career path by obtaining my bachelor's in economics from UC Davis. I would then spend the next two years working with <br>
        mortgage loans at Googain. Googain was an amazing company but ultimately, I decided that the mortgage life was not for me. I went back <br>
        to school to obtain my master's degree in statistics at San Jose State University. It was here that I learned about machine learning models <br>
        and really put my time and work into machine learning. After graduating, I found it diffcult to sell myself as a machine learning engineer. <br>
        Even though I understood the statistics behind the models, my coding skills weren't quite up to par. Now I am self-taught programmer <br>
        and have completed a couple of projects shown below. If you've enjoyed my work and are looking to hire, please don't hesitate to contact me.
